					With driving now holding a prominent position in today's society, it is nearly an essential skill to know how to drive in a safe manner. However, with an increasing number of rules and new technology always appearing, what one must do to stay safe on the road will always continue to change and adapt to the new technology one may find within their vehicles. Considering that many devices in the car pose a risk of distracting the driver, it can sometimes be unclear what the driver can and can not do while driving that puts them at risk of getting into an accident, and what the law prohibits doing on the road may be unknown to some drivers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The purpose of this website is to look into modern issues one may encounter while driving with the technology of today and provide some insight into what one should and should not do while using different technologies in their vehicle. Each section found above was written by a different individual, and examines common issues the average driver may be influenced by on the road. Looking into issues such as using your GPS while driving, using "hands-free" devices in an inappropriate manner, using voice commands to interact with a device, or texting while driving, the goal of this website is to hopefully allow for drivers to notice potentially dangerous behaviours in how they drive and change their perception of what should and should not be done on the road to reduce the risk of crashes in their everyday life.
