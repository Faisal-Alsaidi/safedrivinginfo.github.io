					In an age of technology where modern computers are capable of calculating complex computations in a matter of milliseconds and a large amount of what we do in our everyday lives relies on their ability to perform tasks far quicker and more precise than humans, it is no surprise that the influence of technology has had a major impact on how cars are designed and has opened up a new era of self-driving cars and hands-free technologies which allow for the use of cellphones and other devices while limiting the amount of interaction needed to perform any tasks on them. Despite the innovative modern technology, however, how safe is it to use hands-free devices or rely on self-driving cars when performing tasks? Does it really allow for a safer experience as opposed to doing the task yourself or not doing it at all?
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Some hands-free technologies that are commonplace in vehicles on the road today include <b>cellphone car mounts</b>, <b>Bluetooth earpiece speakers</b>, and <b>in-car touchscreen systems</b>. While these devices are often advertised as being hands-free, interaction with them is certainly still needed to perform any simple task.
				</p>
				<p>
					When looking at the cellphone car mount, for example, while you may be able to operate your phone far easier as opposed to having it sit in a cup holder to your right or holding it in one hand, to take away your attention from the road and focus on what exactly you want to do on your phone and going forth with your desired action certainly requires your attention to primarily be on your phone, resulting in distracted driving. The same could be said about using any in-car touchscreen system and even about Bluetooth earpieces considering that they certainly need some sort of interaction with a phone or the earpiece itself to make or manage any calls. Considering this, using these technologies is incredibly dangerous and should not be looked at as a method of using your phone to do anything that takes your focus off the road as doing so is no different than simply holding the phone in your hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					To prohibit the use of hands-free devices in an inappropriate or dangerous manner, Manitoba law limits the use of car mounts to a minimal, stating that, under the <i>Highway Traffic Amendment Act</i>, “No person shall use a hand-operated electronic device while driving a vehicle on a highway unless, the device is a cellular telephone or another electronic device that includes a telephone function, and is configured and equipped to allow hands-free use as a telephone and is used in a hands-free manner.” Essentially, while cellphone car mounts are not entirely prohibited, they may only be used to allow a phone to make a call in a hands-free manner. While the exact definition of “hands-free” is quite vague, it is clear that any use of phones using “hands-free” technology is prohibited unless it allows for the driver to make a call with absolutely no interactions with their device, so these devices should be avoided to the best of your abilities.

					One of the most innovative new technologies when it comes to how cars are manufactured today are self-driving cars (also known as autonomous vehicles). While this technology is certainly still in development, several options are available today to allow for autonomous vehicles on the road, with Tesla offering various models commercially available in most first-world countries, albeit without having any models which are completely autonomous. However, how safe is it to have computers make every decision for you on the road? Is it any safer than simply driving the car yourself?
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the assumption that autonomous vehicles will continue to improve their technology and algorithms for detecting hazards on the road, they could certainly be a very useful in reducing crashes and fatalities on the road. According to statistics from the <i>Insurance Corporation of British Columbia</i> (ICBC) from 2013, approximately <b>28%</b> of fatal crashes were caused as a result of speeding, <b>23%</b> by drunk driving, and <b>29%</b> by distracted driver (while these statistics may be from several years ago, the statistics have likely stayed consistent throughout the years considering that no major changes have been made to reduce these types of accidents). When taking those statistics into consideration, it can be deduced that at least <b>80%</b> of all fatal car crashes in Canada come as a result of human error, with the percentage likely being far greater if taking all causes into consideration. One of the major reasons that autonomous vehicles would be a great addition into society is because, assuming everyone had access to a vehicle capable of driving itself, the common causes which lead to crashes would be completely non-existent in these vehicles as the programs driving them would be fine tuned to drive perfectly and avoid any inappropriate or unsafe behaviours. Drunk driving, speeding, and distracted driving would be issues easily solved by autonomous vehicles as the vehicle could either start off driving on its own without the need for the driver to be fully aware of the road or detect when the driver is exhibiting unsafe behaviours and take over if needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite this, however, it must also be known that autonomous vehicles are not perfect and are susceptible to making mistakes in detecting hazards. In March of 2018, <a href = "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/uber-self-driving-car-2018-fatal-crash-software-flaws-1.5349581" target = "_blank">an Uber self-driving car struck and killed and woman in Arizona riding a bicycle in front of the vehicle and night</a>. It is believed that this incident occurred as a result of the software recognizing the woman as a pedestrian far too late, resulting in the inability to stop in time and unfortunately leaving the woman in the direct path of the car. While the self-driving car, in this instance, was not totally at fault for the incident, the situation certainly shows that autonomous vehicles are not quite at a point where they are capable of being completely reliable for determining all possible hazards on the road, and leave the chance of flaws in the software to result in crashes. However, as technology continues to improve and the software and AI controlling the vehicles get smarter, these incidents will hopefully become far less frequent in the future, resulting in the autonomous vehicles being capable of driving more efficient than human drivers and allowing for a future where car accidents are reduced to an absolute minimum. Until then, however, it is often suggested that while drivers do not need to be completely attentive on the road, they should still be ready to take over for the AI if things go wrong, so you, as a driver of an autonomous vehicle, should not assume that everything will always go correctly.

					Self-driving cars and hands-free technologies are commonplace in vehicles on the road today and their presence will only continue to increase as the technology improves. While the devices used today certainly do have their aspects which allow for a safer experience on the road, a lot of what we assume to allow for a “hands-free” experience is nothing more than a gimmick as of right now, and does not allow for a situation free of any chance of getting your vehicle into a crash. Humans are incredibly susceptible to distractions, and when it comes to driving on the road, these distractions can be fatal. To risk getting into these crashes is a ridiculous mindset, so while these “hands-free” technologies have their place in the modern vehicle, they should only be used sparingly as they are not yet capable of allowing for a completely “hands-free” experience.
