				<h3><u>Definition</u></h3>
				<p>
					The form of distracted driving when the driver is on his/her hand-held device while operating a motorized vehicle. The driver is unable to be focussed solely on whatâ€™s happening on the road and therefore reckless driving will occur and increase the risk of a collision.
				</p>

				<h3><u>Consequences</u></h3>
				<p>
					The first offence for texting and driving in Manitoba will get you a three-day suspension and a fine between $203-$672. If you have more than two offences within 10 years, you will get a seven-day suspension, a fine of $672, and you will drop five points on the driving scale. Texting and driving will increase the risk of collision by four times.
				</p>

						In July 2010, it became illegal in Manitoba to use a hand-held device while driving.
					</li>
					<li>
						In April 2019 in Winnipeg alone, police suspended more than 400 drivers for texting and driving.
					</li>
