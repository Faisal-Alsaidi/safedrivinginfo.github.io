				<p>
					Many people believe that with all this new technology with voice commands, we have surely eliminated the risk of distracted driving. That is completely wrong. There have been tests for on screen navigation, voice commands, and mapping during a route to drive somewhere, and every option has impaired one’s driving. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Firstly, on-screen GPS systems have proven to slightly distract a driver’s ability to drive safely. While driving, a person must look down at their built-in GPS to see where it tells them to look. Even by glancing down, you are putting yourself at risk. Your peripheral vision is reduced, and you are ne longer focused in the road any more buy on your route on your GPS screen. Just like talking with a friend while driving, the GPS’s voice can also distract you from completely focusing on the road as you should. When you hear its voice, you immediately focus on what you’re hearing rather than what is in front of you. The absolute best GPS option to have is to get a GPS that can attach to your windshield so when you are looking at it you are still semi focused on the road.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, voice commands also slightly impair your driving ability. While talking, your brain is thinking of how you will structure your sentence and what you want to say. While thinking, many people have a habit of rolling their eyes up. This completely takes their vision and focus off the road. While saying your command to the computer in your car you are likely saying what song you want to hear and that can easily distract you not only from singing but you are thinking of what song you want to play, and you do not have your full attention to the road. If you must perform a voice command, ask your passenger to do it rather than you so you can completely focus on the road.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, mapping your route om your phone while you are driving. This is the worst because you are usually looking at your phone on your lap with the road not in your peripheral vision and one or maybe both of your hands are off the steering wheel to operate your phone to navigate to your destination.  This is by far the most dangerous as almost none of your attention is focused to the road but to your phone. Another downside to using your phone is that it is quite easy to become distracted and use social media while driving and the same effects come in but even more detrimental. The best option is to either ask a friend to tell you your route, or to even plan your way before driving so you will know exactly where you are driving.
				</p>
				<p>
					All in all, the assistance to driving through technology is not beneficial at all, and while they do slightly reduce the risk, it still impairs your driving ability from GPS devices, to voice commands, and even using maps on your phone. The best option is to minimize interaction with technology and to drive as if it didn’t exist.
