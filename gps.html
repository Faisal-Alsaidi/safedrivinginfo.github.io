					GPS systems can help you get from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’, and it’s a great tool to use for navigation instead of having an old fashion paper map. But whenever there is something new introduced, there’s always going to be issues along the way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Accidents involving GPS navigations happen more often than you think. Sometimes if there are new changes in the city, the GPS may not be updated to fit the new functions of the roads. GPS stands for <i>Global Position System</i>, which means it’s made from a bunch of satellites so it wouldn’t be updated soon. As a result of that, some people take the instructions too literally. Like for example when the GPS warns, “make a U-turn if possible.” Turning off the instructor voice also is a big no. This causes the driver to become easily distracted (if there’s music or something else playing) and won’t be able to hear what the GPS directions are saying. Also, adjusting while driving can cause an accident. Putting your focus on something else while driving increases the likelihood to get into a crash. Instead, pull over to the side and adjust your GPS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fun fact; The first GPS system was called the <i>1981 Honda w/ Electro Gyro-Cator Navigation Unit</i>. Quite the handful to say. It was made by the company <i>Honda, Alpine and Stanley Electric</i>. The system was first introduced in Japan. The way it worked was it used a small helium gas gyroscope. It was more like the systems used by fighter pilots in the cold war.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though it may seem there’s only one specific type of GPS navigation system, there’s a ton of variety. To start it off there’s street-navigation, sports GPS/watches, PDA based systems, phone GPS and even a GPS for kids.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though there are GPS for kids, that doesn’t mean it’s all <i>that</i> safe. GPS’s can both help yet hurt. They can navigate and lead you to your destination which is great but it also is just a piece of technology. It really doesn’t understand things or what may stand in the way of you getting to where you need to be (like pedestrians, construction, road changes etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
					There are definitely pros and cons to using a GPS. Navigation, functions, and locations are an advantage. You can just type in where you want to go and bam, it has a worked-out route for you to follow. Very convenient right? Sure, but a GPS can also have some system issues, and reliability can be questionable. Like I previously said, if the city decides to change the roads, the GPS is a satellite. It won’t be updated in time. With every piece of technology that’s introduced into the world, there will always be issues with it no matter what.
